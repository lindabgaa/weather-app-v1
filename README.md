The app enables users to effortlessly search for weather information in any city around the world through a user-friendly interface, providing real-time weather forecasts including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. <br>

The data is sourced from the API [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). <br>
